**How to get the R code for the guide**

We hope you're enjoying our guide on how to do Meta-Analysis in R. Here's a description on how you can download the R Code to run your Meta-Analyses yourself.

1.  We have stored all R Code in a repository which you can download onto your computer. To access the repository, click **View on GitHub** on top of this page.

This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Please see the page "[Get Started](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)" at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ for how to compile this example into HTML. You may generate a copy of the book in `bookdown::pdf_book` format by calling `bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::pdf_book')`. More detailed instructions are available here https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/build-the-book.html.

You can find the preview of this example at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown-demo/.
