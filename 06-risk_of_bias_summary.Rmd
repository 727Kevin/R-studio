# Creating a RevMan style Risk of Bias summary

## Preparing your Risk of Bias data

In many Meta-Analyses, you will also want to have a look at the quality of included studies using the [**RevMan Risk of Bias assessment tool**](https://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/chapter_8/8_6_presentation_of_assessments_of_risk_of_bias.htm). However, many researchers don't use **RevMan** to conduct Meta-Analyses, one has to put some extra effort into inserting all study quality data by hand into RevMan, which is extremely time-consuming.

Furthermore, the quality of the Risk of Bias (RoB) summary figures in RevMan are of suboptimal picture quality. Many journals will require figures with better quality, or figures saved in another format (such as **.svg** or **.pdf**).

To avoid all of this, you can easily plot the **RoB Summary in RStudio yourself**.
To do this, we again have to prepare an EXCEL sheet in which we store our RoB data. In [Chapter 3.1.1](#excel_preparation), we already described how the preparation and import of EXCEL sheets into RStudio works in general. For this data sheet, you need to follow a few guidelines:

* Name the first column **Author**, and put all the study names in this column (e.g., Frogeli et al.)
* Give the other **columns a name signifying the RoB criterion** you assessed. Do this for all criteria you want to have included in your plot. **Important**: when naming your column, do not use spaces between word, but use underscores or points instead (e.g. allocation_concealment)
* In these columns, you have to describe if the study received a **High**, **Low**, or **Unclear** risk of bias rating. Use exactly these codes for your data, including upper and lowercase (R is case sensitive)
* Do **not** store any other information in your data (e.g. commentaries on your RoB decision)

## Plotting the summary

To plot the summary, we have to import our dataset first. We describe how to do this in [Chapter 3.2](#import_excel). I simply called my dataset `rob`.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
load("rob.RData")
rob<-rob_e
rob$Author<-rob$Study_ID
rob$Study_ID<-NULL

```

Let's have a look at the structure of the data first:

```{r}
str(rob)
```

We can see that we have the data imported in RStudio now, with ratings for every criterion in each column. If you named your columns differently, or used less or more criteria, this is not that important now. We will get to this later.

We will plot the summary using the packages `ggplot2` and `tidyr`. They should be installed as part of the `tidyverse`, but be sure to have it on your computer, and then load them from your **library**.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
```

We can than use a predefined code to generate our first plot. To do this, we have to check if a few things about our dataset are correctly defined.

1. You have to rename your dataset to `rob` for the syntax to work. In my case, the dataset already has this name, so it is kind of redundant. Paste the name of your dataset on the right side of the arrow to rename your data using this code:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
rob<-Name.of.your.data
```

2. We have to **transform our data for the plot**. To do this, we only have to check in our dataset which risk of bias criterion appears first, and which appears last in our file. To do this, we'll use the `str()` function again

```{r}
str(rob)
```
We see that our dataset starts with the variable `RoB_sequence`, and that the last RoB column is `RoB_identifcal_post_timing`.

We now have to tell the transformation function that we want all RoB criteria, from `RoB_sequence` to `RoB_identifcal_post_timing`, to be included in the plot. To do this, we have to insert `RoB_sequence:RoB_identifcal_post_timing` after `measurement` in the following code:

```{r}
rob.long <- gather(rob, 
                   condition, measurement, 
                   RoB_sequence:RoB_identical_post_timing, 
                   factor_key=TRUE)
rob.long$measurement<-as.factor(rob.long$measurement)
rob.long$measurement<-factor(rob.long$measurement,
                             levels(rob.long$measurement)[c(1,3,2)])
```


The rest of the code, we can leave as is. Note that the string `RoB_sequence:RoB_identifcal_post_timing` can look totally different for you, because you only have to use the names of the column that you have for your dataset. 
  
So, if your first RoB column in the dataset was `allocation_concealment`, and your last one `cointerventions`, the string would be called `allocation_concealment:cointerventions`, and the code would look like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rob.long <- gather(rob, 
                   condition, measurement, 
                   allocation_concealment:cointerventions, 
                   factor_key=TRUE)
rob.long$measurement<-as.factor(rob.long$measurement)
rob.long$measurement<-factor(rob.long$measurement,
                             levels(rob.long$measurement)[c(1,3,2)])
```
                             
3. Now, it's time to plot our first graph. We will call this plot `rob.summary`. As you've prepared your data already, just run the code below:

```{r, fig.width=11.69, fig.height=8.27}
rob.summary<-ggplot(data=rob.long)+
  geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=condition,fill=measurement),
           width=0.7, 
           position = "fill",
           color="black")+
  coord_flip(ylim = c(0,1))+
  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))+
  scale_fill_manual("Risk of Bias",
                    labels = c("    High risk of bias          ",
                               "    Unclear risk of bias       ",
                               "    Low risk of bias  "),
                    values = c("Unclear" = "#E2DF07",
                               "High" = "#BF0000",
                               "Low" = "#02C100"))+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.title.y.left=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y.left = element_text(size=18, color = "black"),
        axis.line.x = element_line(colour = "black", 
                                 size = 0.5, linetype = "solid"),
        legend.position = "bottom",
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        legend.background = element_rect(linetype="solid", 
                                         colour ="black"),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.key.size = unit(0.75,"cm"),
        legend.text=element_text(size=14))
rob.summary
```

4. We see that RStudio has already **created a RoB summary plot**, but there's something missing. The labels for each RoB criterion on the left are the **raw names** we gave each column, so we should change them to their actual name. To do this, we have to attach the correct labels for each criterion to our `rob.summary`plot.

5. To do this, we have to attach `+` a function which describes which label should be replaced with which name. A generic version looks like this:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
rob.summary<-rob.summary+
  scale_x_discrete(labels=c("former_criterion_name_1" = "New Criterion Name 1", 
                            "former_criterion_name_2" = "New Criterion Name 2"))

```

Just define **all** the criterion labels this was way, and do not forget to separate them with a comma within the bracket (except for the last one).

If i do this for my data, it looks like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rob.summary<-rob.summary+
scale_x_discrete(labels=c("RoB_sequence" = "Sequence generation", 
                            "RoB_allocation_concealment_" = "Allocation Concealment",
                            "RoB_Blinding of participants and personnel" = "Blinding of participants and personnel",
                            "RoB_Blinding of outcome assessors" = "Blinding of outcome assessors",
                            "RoB_Incomplete outcome data for all outcomes" = "Incomplete outcome data",
                            "RoB_Selective outcome reporting" = "Selective outcome reporting",
                            "RoB_Co-interventions" = "Co-Interventions",
                            "RoB_Serious_flaw" = "Serious flaw",
                            "RoB_ITT" = "ITT Analyses",
                            "RoB_SimilarGroups" = "Similar Groups",
                            "RoB_compliance" = "Compliance",
                            "RoB_identical_post_timing" = "Identical Post Timing"))

```

We have not updated the labels in the `rob.summary` plot. Let's have a peek how it looks now:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rob.summary<-rob.summary+
scale_x_discrete(labels=c("RoB_sequence" = "Sequence generation", 
                            "RoB_allocation_concealment_" = "Allocation Concealment",
                            "RoB_Blinding of participants and personnel" = "Blinding of participants and personnel",
                            "RoB_Blinding of outcome assessors" = "Blinding of outcome assessors",
                            "RoB_Incomplete outcome data for all outcomes" = "Incomplete outcome data",
                            "RoB_Selective outcome reporting" = "Selective outcome reporting",
                            "RoB_Co-interventions" = "Co-Interventions",
                            "RoB_Serious_flaw" = "Serious flaw",
                            "RoB_ITT" = "ITT Analyses",
                            "RoB_SimilarGroups" = "Similar Groups",
                            "RoB_compliance" = "Compliance",
                            "RoB_identical_post_timing" = "Identical Post Timing"))

```

```{r, fig.width=11.69, fig.height=8.27}
rob.summary
```

Looks good so far.  

## Saving the Summary Plot {#saving}

I want to save the plot as a **PDF** file in my working directory. To do this, define the name as the file as `rob_summary.pdf`, and save it at the same time in the correct size and orientation using this code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pdf(file='rob_summary.pdf', width = 11.69, height = 8.27) 
rob.summary;dev.off() 
```

I can also save the plot as **PNG** file using this command.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
png(file='rob_summary.png', width = 842, height = 595) 
rob.summary;dev.off() 
```

Or as a **Scalable Vector Graphic** (.svg) with this command.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
svg(file='rob_summary.svg', width = 11.69, height = 8.27) 
rob.summary;dev.off() 
```
