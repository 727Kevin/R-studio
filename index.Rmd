# About this Guide

![](C:/Users/Admin/Documents/R/WORKING_DIRECTORY/Meta-Analyse Buch/bookdown-demo-master/coverbild.jpg)

```{block,type='rmdinfo'}
This guide shows you how to conduct Meta-Analyses in R from scratch. The focus of this guide is primarily on clinical outcome research in psychology. The guide is designed for staff and collaborators of the [**PROTECT Lab**](https://www.protectlab.org), which is headed by **Dr. David D. Ebert**.
```



```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3,fig.height=2}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("C:/Users/Admin/Documents/R/WORKING_DIRECTORY/Meta-Analyse Buch/bookdown-demo-master/protectlogo.PNG")
grid.raster(img)
```


**The guide will teach you how to:**
 
* Get **R** and **RStudio** set for your Meta-Analysis
* Get your data into R
* Prepare your data for the meta-analysis
* Perform fixed- and random-effects meta-analysis using the `meta` and `metafor`packages
* Analyse the heterogeneity of your results
* Tackle heterogeneity using subgroup analyses and meta-regression
* Check if selective outcome reporting is a present in your data
* Control for selective outcome reporting
* Analyse the risk of bias in your data
* Do advanced types of meta-analyses, such as 
    + network analyses or 
    + meta-analyses with more than one outcome

**What this guide will not cover**

Although this guide will provide some information on the statistics behind meta-analysis, it will not give you an in-depth introduction into how meta-analyses are calculated mathematically.
  
It is also beyond the scope of this guide to advise in detail which meta-analytical strategy is suited bestin certain contexts, and on how the search, study inclusion and reporting of meta-analyses should be conducted. The [*Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions*](http://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/), however, should be a great source to find more information on these topics.

<br><br>
  
**Generally, there a two other books to recommended when conducting Meta-Analyses:**
  
* If you're looking for a easily digestable, ready-to-use book on how Meta-Analyses can be conducted, we can recommend **Pim Cuijpers' online courses on Meta-Analysis**. The courses are freely available on YouTube. To have a look, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP7_VBrG_TY&list=PL-h5cI5Bkvt0J-O0kq_9J9_aksWFPgR7s).
* If you're interested in more details on how to conduct Meta-Analyses in R, you can either have a look at Wolfgang Viechtbauer's page for the `metafor` package ([Link](http://metafor-project.org)). Or you can consult a book on the `meta` package which was recently published [@schwarzer2015meta].
